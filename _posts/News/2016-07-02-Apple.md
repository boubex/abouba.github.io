Construction on Apple’s massive new campus is nearing completion.

The ‘spaceship’ or ‘mothership’ as some are calling it is set to open some time next year. The circular building is massive in scale and includes a 100,000 square-foot fitness center, 11,000-car parking garage topped with solar panels the building will need to produce some 20-megawatts (enough to power 3,000 homes) of power and a massive auditorium that could play host to future Apple events, like WWDC or employee-centric events featuring notable Apple employees Dr. Dre and Trent Reznor providing the entertainment.

There’s still plenty of work to do, but if you compare this video from early 2015 (top) to the current fly-over yesterday (bottom), you can see just how far Apple has come.
