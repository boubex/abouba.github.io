A rather quiet month in Africa once again dominated by two household Uber 

Uber is speeding up its expansion in Africa after initially launching in South Africa, Kenya and Nigeria. June saw launches in Dar es Salaam, Accra and Kampala, signalling Uber’s first forays into Tanzania, Ghana and Uganda, while the taxi app also launches in a third Kenyan city – Thika.

The company is also expanding and remodelling its offerings across the rest of the continent, and will shortly be adding delivery and courier services to its bouquet. In Nigeria it has ditched UberBLACK in favor of UberSELECT.

Yet it may face more competition as well. In Kenya, Uber’s second African market, leading local mobile operator Safaricom is partnering with a local software firm to launch a rival taxi-hailing service which it says will be better for the local economy.

It remains to be seen whether this new app will fare better than others that have tried to compete with the financial might of Uber.
